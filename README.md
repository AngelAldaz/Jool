# Jool

### A Community Knowledge-Sharing Platform

**Jool** is a community-driven Q&A platform inspired by models like StackOverflow and Yahoo Answers. Designed as a collaborative knowledge-sharing tool, it allows members of the **AAAIMX organization** to:

- **Ask questions** on topics of interest
- **Provide answers** and share expertise
- **Engage in discussions** to foster peer learning

By encouraging open collaboration, Jool helps build a richer, collective understanding across diverse subjects. Join us in growing knowledge together!
